**Hold On Dear Life**

Hold on to your life instead of chasing moneys,
If you want to chase something, chase financial Indepence.

This Website is an extension of [🚀Hodlers🌞 Discord Group](https://discord.gg/bB5WRbemFR) created to unite and help each other understand our rich we are, nurturing and empowering the community.
If you managed to get here, you probably came for money($), whoever i hope you chose to stay for everything else and for the real money. Together we can understand what is money and how you can trade for profit.

"The lips of wisdom are closed, except to the ears of understanding"
*The Kybalion*

To understand what we are holding on, you must first come to observe and understand your priorities and beliefs.
What do you value the most?
How do you spend your time?
How do you value your time?

“Most of us have to consider our finances in nearly every decision we make, or maybe even make decisions solely based on money. But once we reach financial independence, we get the freedom not to be bossed around by what we earn or what we have saved.”

The goal is to **accumulate crypto assets** in order **to generate passive income**.

By doing so, we can concentrate on what is essential for us and live our life to the fullest.

By bypassing traditional financial systems such as banks or governments, **crypto** gives people control over their money and lives.

With crypto, you are in full control of your money.

Crypto is a new financial asset that you can grow over the long term without doing much, through different methods such as lending or staking.
This way, crypto assets can help you achieve financial independence.

**HODLING** 
*HODL your crypto and wait for the value of your assets to potentially increase over time.*
-Buy on dip and HODL!
I use [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/ucenter/signup?rcode=y5avv8) to find new gems and access to new token spotligths, among with other amazing strategies, it is the peoples exchange 😊

**INCREASE YOUR HOLDINGS BY:**

**LENDING**
Lend your crypto in exchange for interest payments.
Like a loan from a bank, except that you are the bank.
