**What is Financial Independence?**

Can be described as a state where you simply donâ€™t need to work anymore because **youâ€™ve got enough money coming in from elsewhere to live on for the foreseeable future**

The goal is to **accumulate assets** such as stocks, real estate or savings in order **to generate passive income.**

By doing so, people can concentrate on what is essential for them and live their life to the fullest.

By bypassing traditional financial systems such as banks or governments, crypto gives people control over their money and lives.
With crypto, you are in full control of your money, completely unreliant on anyone or anything else.
Thatâ€™s true financial independence.

Crypto is a new financial asset that you can grow over the long term without doing much, through different methods such as lending or staking.
